Cancer mutations in Sororin protein - Q96FF9<br>
Matteo Pedrazzi<br>

The Sororin protein, encoded by the CDCA5 gene, plays a critical role in maintaining genomic
stability and regulating cell division. Alterations in Sororin due to cancer-associated mutations
have been implicated in various types of cancers, but a comprehensive analysis of these mutations is
still lacking. The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed investigation of cancer mutations in the
human Sororin gene CDCA5, through the analysis of publicly available cancer genomics databases,
identifying the spectrum of cancer mutations in CDCA5 across the full sequence and trying to study
how these mutations are involved in tissue-specific effects and their association with distinct cancer
types. The distribution of these mutations is also studied with respect to structural properties of
the sequence and the predicted secondary structures, revealing recurrent mutations and potential
hotspot regions within the protein sequence, shedding light on critical residues susceptible to cancer-
associated alterations, trying to help in the search of potential links that would contributes to a
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis.
